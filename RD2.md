* Purpose: This lab we were tasked to take last weeks lab and use functions on the code. 


This lab we were supposed to become better at using functions.
Using functions semi "simplify" the code because we can recall the functions. Still, understanding how to use 
the functions was the difficult part. To start off we tried to understand what we can turn into functions.
Our results matched what we expected from the code. We had an issue once we finished the functions because it wasn't running
properly. Another issue that happened was with the withdraw function. It wasn't subtracting the balance properly when the amount withdrawn was
more than their current balance. I was able to fix it and understand what the problem was.

Working with my partner, Ray, this week went well again. Although it did take us a while to make the code when we met up.
